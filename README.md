# Arena Backend Engineer Take-Home Exercise

üéâ Welcome to the Arena take-home coding exercise! üéâ

This backend exercise is designed to take about 3 hours for someone familiar with `Node.js` and `Express`. Additionally, `GraphQL` will be a major part of this exercise. We do not expect you to know anything about `GraphQL` prior to taking this exercise. We'd be happier if you ended up learning something new out of this exercise.

There are many different ways to complete this exercise. We wanted to keep it open ended and give you some creative freedom. As such, even though you don't need to, you may install and use any extra npm package.

## Setup

- The exercise requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. We recommend using the LTS version.
- In the repo root directory, run `npm install` to gather all dependencies.
- Next, run `npm run setup`. This will set up a local SQLite database, and add some seed data. This database will live in a local file named `database.sqlite3`.
- Then run `npm run watch`. This should start the server in development mode.

## Getting Started

If you've never heard of `GraphQL`, don't worry ‚Äî you'll be able to learn it in no time! You don't need to go deep and learn everything about it.

For starters, üëâ [go through this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-build-a-graphql-server-with-minimal-effort-fc7fcabe8ebd/) üëà and you'll learn all the basic skills necessary to complete this exercise.

## Technical Notes

- The server is running with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/), which will automatically restart for you when you modify and save a file.
- The database provider is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), which will store data in a local file called `database.sqlite3`.
- The database client is [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/). For any database operation, you should only have to interact with `Sequelize`.
- You will be implementing a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) server. We have set up [Apollo Express Server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-express) and [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) for you.

## Exercise

- You will be building a simple support ticket tracker. In this exercise, a `ticket` is defined as a task that has a `title`. The ticket is either `completed` or `incomplete` at any given time. It has a recursive structure, meaning that it may have `children` tickets. Those children tickets may further have children tickets of their own, and so on. For example:

```json5
{
  "title": "first ticket",
  "isCompleted": false,
  "children": [
    {
      "title": "second ticket",
      "isCompleted": true,
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "title": "third ticket",
      "isCompleted": false,
      "children": [
        {
          "title": "fourth ticket",
          "isCompleted": true,
          "children": [///...]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- Your task is building the backend `GraphQL` api to maintain this system. You will be coding the `GraphQL` resolvers that successfully implement the `typedefs` we have provided.
- We also created the `Ticket` model. Even though it is not necessary, you may modify this model as you wish. In `server.js`, you'll see one example usage of said model.

## Before Starting

- ‚ùóÔ∏è **Make sure you commit all changes to the master branch!**
- Do not worry about performance.
- To start, go to http://localhost:4001/graphql. This will pull up a GUI called [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) that lets you fire `GraphQL` queries against your api.

## Submitting the Assignment

When you have finished the assignment, run the following command:

```sh
git bundle create take-home-exercise.bundle HEAD master
```

This generates a bundle file called `take-home-exercise` based on your local master branch. Upload the bundle to Google Drive or Dropbox and send us the link. We'll review your code within 1-2 days.

Thank you and good luck! üôè
